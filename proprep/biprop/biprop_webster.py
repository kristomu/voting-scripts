# Biproportional apportionment: let there be n parties and m regions, and
# let a party x's support in region y be v_xy. Let the sum of seats for 
# region t be

# sr_t = sum k=1...n 	round(v_kt * r_t * p_k)
# and the sum of seats for party q be
# sp_q = sum k=1...m 	round(v_qk * r_k * p_q)

# where r_1...r_m are the region multipliers and p_1...p_n are the party
# multipliers.

# Then, given desired region and party sums R_1..R_m, P_1...P_m, alternate
# 	adjusting r_1...r_m so that sr_t=D_t for all t.
#	adjusting p_1...p_n so that sp_q=P_q for all q.

# I.e.: assign each region a region weight and each party a party
# weight. Then alternatedly adjust region and party weights to make
# apportionments of weighted support give the number of seats desired for 
# each region and vice versa.

# ==========================================================================

# This idea might be generalizable to my Bucklin/facility location problem
# method. It might also be generalizable to methods that pass mono-raise if
# we let increasing the party mulitplier mean more and more voters's ranking
# of candidates from party X are raised.

# 2D apportionment code. This is written from a region point of view;
# the party adjustment is the same, just with party and region factors
# switched and with a 90 deg rotated count matrix. 

# We have current party and region factors and we want to alter the region
# factors so that we get the right number of seats in each region. 
# We can do so by doing an apportionment region by region and 
# noting down the factor this apportionment finds.

# That is, for region A, we want to find y so that
# (SUM i=1..n: f(x_i * party_1_factor * y)) = num seats for A

# which is the same as finding the apportionment factor for
# [x_1 * party_1_factor, ..., x_n * party_n_factor], and then 
# the new factor for region A is y.
